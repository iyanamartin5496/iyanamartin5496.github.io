<p> In Bill Moggride’s, second chapter of Designing Interactions, he sheds light regarding two other guys–who coincidentally are both also named Bill. The first Bill he introduces is Bill Atkinson, a man with a “passion for research and experiment” that lead him into being the head designer on the Apple Lisa prototype’s user interface  (87). What I found most impressive about him was his in–depth collection, his archive that documented every step taken to produce and evolve the software. “In the user interface design, a lot of it was by trial and error. We tried different things and found out what did and didn’t work. A lot of it was empirically determined” (89). I feel like this quote perfectly describes the art of coding. Everything you do is trial and error. We’re later introduced to Bill Verplank who breaks down interaction design to a series of questions and steps that are imperative to follow through a thorough idea. I think the accompanied sketches for this part of the text illustrate another interesting way to document the process of your working concept as it progresses. </p>
