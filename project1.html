			<div id="column1"> 
				<p> Kids of Immigrants began simply as an idea, an idea to make the best with that we had and to create pieces that which radiated love. That idea came to fruition through <a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-collection/ target="blank" /> <i> “THE FREEDOM PROJECT.”</i></a> This was our first project that showcased KOI as a brand, and visualized what we defined as real freedom. Our second project, <a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-now target="blank" /> <i>‘FREEDOM NOW’</i> </a> took that definition and expanded it, further progressing of our movement. Now we take action and demand it. Freedom that begins now, from within, starts with the self and resonates to the world.

				To create <a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-now target="blank" /> <i>‘FREEDOM NOW’</i> </a>, we delved back into our roots, back to the “trap house,” and began creating one–of­–a­–kind unique pieces. We’ve always been inspired to create whatever we wanted; without barriers, without fear. We believe if true inspiration takes time, so does the production. Our process, technique and attention to detail show hand craftsmanship and ingenuity in each piece, something that has become hand­-sewn and engraved into our still growing brand. Each piece has a story; made with love, passion and imperfections. After deconstructing, repurposing and remastering dozens of pieces, we were ready to showcase. <br><br>

				When we first began thinking about KOI, we had no clue how we would convey our idea. We knew we were passionate about creating pieces that would express and embody an empowering message of love. So we took a chance, and started the conversation<a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-collection/ target="blank" /> <i> “THE FREEDOM PROJECT.”</i></a>

			<div id="column2"> 
				<p> We brainstormed dozens of ideas, going back and forth on how exactly how we sought to portray our important message. Inevitably, we ended up right back at our true purpose that ignited KOI in the first place: the people. We knew from that point on­ no models, nothing staged, nothing inauthentic. 
				The concept then became clear and straight to the point. We thought, let’s look for a location, call our friends, try some 
				cool clothes on, vibe out and take pictures. We knew we had to shoot not only our friends, but the faces that inspired 
				us on the street everyday. These people spanned from the kids playing basketball in the yard next door, to the 
				neighbors coming home from work in the evening. We 
				could really feel our intuition feeding the raw energy 
				we needed for this project. </p>

				<p> A month in, with about 30 different pieces, we felt ready to showcase our work in a more professional light. We were in love with the pieces we created and felt they had developed into pieces of art that embodied our impactful message of love. Our close friends Christine and Jordan were vital in creating these pieces. They enabled us to produce more than our two hands could have done alone; we would work all night if we needed to. From brainstorming, running errands, cooking food, sewing to taking photos–we did it all together. We did it all for what we were building and representing
				<a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/shop/spread-love-oversized-and-distressed-hoodie-red-1 target="blank"> 
				<i> –LOVE.”</i></a> 
				<br><br>

				My co–worker at Opening Ceremony, Jerald “Jaye” Johnson, a very talented and creative photographer, had been a good friend of mine for over two years now. We have worked on separate projects toget–er in the the past. When it came down to deciding who would should the ‘Freedom Project,’ there were no questions who would
				best capture our vision.<br><br> </p>

				<p>We set up to shoot at an abandoned house painted in bright tones of yellow, green, and pink yet uniquely weathered from what had clearly been a house fire. The windows were 
				boarded up and there was a basketball hoop out back where the kids would play everyday as soon as school was out. We also set up in the backyard several doors down from the trap house, with about 15 of our friends, a makeshift net dripping in KOI pieces, a few rolls of film and our friend photographer, Adam Elramly. <br><br>

				Look after look, shot after shot, it was all effortless. It was simply friends, great vibes, some drinks and a camera. We looked around and realized that love made it happen again, the energy was undeniable. 
				No standard, no comparison, no reference, just true freedom. </p>

				<p> Not only is he the best at what he does, but he’s damn near family to me. I asked him to come over to the house and check out the pieces we had made so far for the <a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-collection/ target="blank" /> <i> “THE FREEDOM PROJECT.”</i></a> As he looked through the pieces, he had a look in his eyes I cannot describe. He believed in our project before it was even  nished! He saw 30 pieces that were nearly completed. He said, “Let’s shoot it.” It was as simple as that. 
				<br><br>
				We then set a date and agreed that our close friends and fellow Opening Ceremony family members, Nathaniel and Mariah, would best personify the <a href=http://www.kidsofimmigrants.us/freedom-collection/ target="blank" /> <i> “THE FREEDOM PROJECT.”</i></a> Both of them were genuinely excited when we asked them to be apart of the shoot. Now it was game time.

				<p> 
				We now had only 10 days to fully prepare for the shoot. Time was tight but we loved every second of it. The rush, the execution of each piece, the struggles, the grind, the mishaps, it was all part of the journey and we embraced every moment of it with open arms.
				<br><br>
				Two days before the shoot, Weleh created the KOI logo patch out of some extra denim fabric. He hand-painted it, then cut it into what is now the signature shape. This was one of the most catalyst moments of KOI. Every piece that we felt needed one last element, the KOI logo denim patch  lled that void. It was the  nishing touch to every single piece. What a blessing, we were relieved. We were only steps closer to our  nish line.
