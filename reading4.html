<div id="title"> Hate Crime vs. </div> 

<div id="bills"> "Freedom of Speech" </div>

<p> In Donyae Coles’, <i> How Reporting and Moderation On Social Media is Failing Marginalized Groups</i>, she breaks down the oppression people of color through the means of social media. She brought up a great point that, “by their own admission, most of the staff, across the board, for Facebook and Twitter are both male and white, leaving the people in charge ill-equipped to determine what is or isn’t bigoted on their platform.” This is such an important facet in social media policing trolls. Trolls is a vague word, but Coles in particular is addressing those who spew hate on the internet towards people’s race, gender, sexuality, religion, etc. Hate crime essentially is policed by the white men who control the majority of the tech industry. What’s the obvious problem with this? “Due to the homogeneous nature of their employees, there are obvious missing spots in their policy procedures, simply because privilege means that you do not have to account for many of the various needs and cultural offenses that marginalized people of color experience… In order to create and execute policy more effectively, social platforms would need to take steps to address not just the content of their policies, but how policies and reporting mechanisms can themselves be weaponized by privileged users — particularly White users — against users of color. ” Hate speech vs. freedom of expression can not be fairly accessed between hundreds of people who represent the same demographic. </a></p>
