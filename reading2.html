<div id="title"> Unpacking <br> the word </div> 

<div id="bills"> <i>interaction</i> </div>

<p> In Hugh Dubberly, Paul Pangaro and Usman Haque, What is Interaction?, We learn about and unpack the many facets of the definition–interaction. “Pressing a button or turning a lever are often described as basic interactions. Yet reaction to input is not the same as learning, conversing, collaborating, or designing. By looking beyond common notions of interactions for a more rigorous definition, we increate the possibilities open to design” (9). I liked this discussion based text because it gave you a variety of perspectives–truly unpacking what the word interaction means. By opening up this discussion, designers can make computing richer in regards to human interaction. By reacting, regulating, learning, balancing, managing, entertaining, and conversing, we can invest in a better user experience.  </p>
