<p> Sina Bahram presents, <i> Perspectives and Advice on Accessibility and Universal Design </i> to a room full of librarians. Bahram talks about how being "functionally blind" has led him to educate people about what it means to <i> design inclusively</i>. He breaks it down to seven essentials—<b>1.</b> Equitable Use, <b>2.</b> Flexibility in Use, <b>3.</b> Simple and Intuitive, <b>4.</b> Perceptible Information, <b>5.</b> Tolerance for error, <b>6.</b> Low physical effort, <b>7.</b> Size and space for approach and use I liked how he emphasized that design explicitly influences how you feel and how interface users will feel through your decisions. Being aware of the functional limitations design can create greater opportunity. It’s important to think of all audiences and not just the audiences you want or expect. The design industry ignores the accessibility of their users because consumer marketing is often geared towards able-bodied people. This lecture reminds me of designers, Lucy Jones and Angela Luna: recent Parsons graduates who both design apparel for an inclusive market.
